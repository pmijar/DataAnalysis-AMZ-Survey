# DataAnalysis-AMZ-Survey
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. 


## Findings:
Observation 1: With increase in temperature coupon usage increased
Observation 2: As the time to reach coupon location increases the coupon usage decreased
Observation 3: Coffee house coupon category was the most used
